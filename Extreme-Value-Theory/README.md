# This is for extreme value theory project.

The idea of the project is to spatially predict extreme precipitation in the future and help determine possible occurances of flood events.

The dataset: Spain daily precipitation data at 0.1 degree(~10km geographically) for 55 years.
             Use 300 most-populated cities in Spain as our precipitation station for model construction. Consider other precipitation data as the checking for our prediction.

1. Fit daily extreme precipitation data to Generalized-Pareto(GPï¼‰ distribution and examine the goodness-of-fit.

2. Construct a spatial model for GP parameters using multiple regression method.

3. Use the model to predict the future extreme precipitation events.

4. Compare these predictions with dataset for checking the validity of the method.
