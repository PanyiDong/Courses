# This is for extreme value theory project.

The idea of the project is to spatially predict extreme precipitation in the future and help determine possible occurances of flood events.

The dataset:

1. Fit daily extreme precipitation data to Generalized-Pareto(GPï¼‰ distribution and examine the goodness-of-fit.
