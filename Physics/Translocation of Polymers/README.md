# This is graduate project, which focus on translocation of polymers

This project uses Langevin dynamic equation to simulate the dynamics of polymers.
In reality, we focused on the escape process. The escape process starts at the initial structure where the center of the polymer at the the hole and two parts in left/right space each. We tried to simulate the process of polymer chains escape to one side of the space (all polymer beads in one space) and recorded the escape time. Then we tried to determine the hidden physics of such behaviors.

In the project, factors like chain length, stiffness/softness, temperature are studied. All escape time behaviors have been concluded using polymer chain structure entropy and dynamic force.

The simulation codes are written in Fortran and data process codes are written in Python. Only data process codes are avaiable here.
